#Magical 8 Ball App

  1.I have created a 'Magical 8 Ball' iOS Application which rolls up and shows a 'Random predicyion' upon clicking the button. 
  2.I did incorporate 'Random class' from Swift language which lets the ball to pick a random card from the given array upon clicking the button. 
  3.You can either tap or shake the iPhone to let the die roll down
